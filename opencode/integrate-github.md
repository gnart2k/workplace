# GitHub Integration Status

The project currently has a robust foundation for GitHub integration, with the latest commit (`d30077a`) focusing on adding a Personal Access Token (PAT) connection method.

## Implemented Features

The integration covers the following key areas:

1.  **Connection & Authentication:**
    *   Support for connecting via GitHub App installation (OAuth flow, implied by `verify-github-installation.ts`).
    *   Support for connecting via Personal Access Token (PAT) (`create-pat-github-integration.ts`).
    *   Endpoints for creating, retrieving, and deleting GitHub integrations.

2.  **Data Synchronization & Webhooks:**
    *   Functionality to import existing GitHub issues into the system (`import-issues.ts`).
    *   Utilities to handle synchronization events for issues and tasks, suggesting two-way sync is in place or being built:
        *   Handling of GitHub issue opened and closed events (`issue-opened.ts`, `issue-closed.ts`).
        *   Handling of internal task creation, status changes, and priority changes (to be reflected back on GitHub, e.g., `task-created.ts`, `task-status-changed.ts`).
    *   Utilities for formatting GitHub comments and task descriptions.

3.  **Utilities:**
    *   Encryption utility for securely storing sensitive data like PATs.
    *   Utilities for creating Octokit instances for both GitHub App and PAT connections.
    *   Logic for parsing GitHub URLs and extracting issue priority.
    *   Endpoint to list a user's available repositories for integration.
